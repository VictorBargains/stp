## Shoot The Projectionist Website Custom WordPress Theme
This theme was built for the website http://shoottheprojectionist.com to host podcast episodes and a related blog using WordPress. It is based on the `simple-bootstrap` theme with customizations of sidebars and menus.

- A custom template for single podcasts, with a separate template for podcast metadata
- An extension to the WordPress audio player to add a play/pause button to the center of the featured image, so podcasts can be streamed by clicking on the image (and it will correctly change to pause when the player starts playing)
- Homepage sidebar which uses bootstrap and media queries to adapt to various screen widths
- Various style overrides and theme integrations of third party plugins
